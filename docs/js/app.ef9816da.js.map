Each marker is represented by <code>latLng</code> (array of two numeric values), <code>name</code> (string which will be show on marker's tip) and any marker styles.\n * @param {Object} params.series Object with two keys: <code>markers</code> and <code>regions</code>. Each of which is an array of series configs to be applied to the respective map elements. See <a href=\"jvm.DataSeries.html\">DataSeries</a> description for a list of parameters available.\n * @param {Object|String} params.focusOn This parameter sets the initial position and scale of the map viewport. See <code>setFocus</code> docuemntation for possible parameters.\n * @param {Object} params.labels Defines parameters for rendering static labels. Object could contain two keys: <code>regions</code> and <code>markers</code>. Each key value defines configuration object with the following possible options:\n<ul>\n  <li><code>render {Function}</code> - defines method for converting region code or marker index to actual label value.</li>\n  <li><code>offsets {Object|Function}</code> - provides method or object which could be used to define label offset by region code or marker index.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Plase note: static labels feature is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and below.</b>\n * @param {Array|Object|String} params.selectedRegions Set initially selected regions.\n * @param {Array|Object|String} params.selectedMarkers Set initially selected markers.\n * @param {Function} params.onRegionTipShow <code>(Event e, Object tip, String code)</code> Will be called right before the region tip is going to be shown.\n * @param {Function} params.onRegionOver <code>(Event e, String code)</code> Will be called on region mouse over event.\n * @param {Function} params.onRegionOut <code>(Event e, String code)</code> Will be called on region mouse out event.\n * @param {Function} params.onRegionClick <code>(Event e, String code)</code> Will be called on region click event.\n * @param {Function} params.onRegionSelected <code>(Event e, String code, Boolean isSelected, Array selectedRegions)</code> Will be called when region is (de)selected. <code>isSelected</code> parameter of the callback indicates whether region is selected or not. <code>selectedRegions</code> contains codes of all currently selected regions.\n * @param {Function} params.onMarkerTipShow <code>(Event e, Object tip, String code)</code> Will be called right before the marker tip is going to be shown.\n * @param {Function} params.onMarkerOver <code>(Event e, String code)</code> Will be called on marker mouse over event.\n * @param {Function} params.onMarkerOut <code>(Event e, String code)</code> Will be called on marker mouse out event.\n * @param {Function} params.onMarkerClick <code>(Event e, String code)</code> Will be called on marker click event.\n * @param {Function} params.onMarkerSelected <code>(Event e, String code, Boolean isSelected, Array selectedMarkers)</code> Will be called when marker is (de)selected. <code>isSelected</code> parameter of the callback indicates whether marker is selected or not. <code>selectedMarkers</code> contains codes of all currently selected markers.\n * @param {Function} params.onViewportChange <code>(Event e, Number scale)</code> Triggered when the map's viewport is changed (map was panned or zoomed).\n */\njvm.Map = function(params) {\n  var map
